# RootMetrics_Coding_Challenge

Here is a recruitment coding challenge presented by RootMetrics that is composed of two questions. Also included is a solution to each of the questions. The solutions rely heavily on the Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Json packages. They are also coded with the assumption that the source data file is in the same directory as the solution files.

##iPython Solution
The solutions to both questions are packaged in a single iPython notebook (RootMetrics_Coding_Challenge.ipynb). It was created for a Python 2.7 environment.

## Python script solution
The solutions have also been copied into two Python 2.7 scripts (question1.py and question2.py), in case you aren't familiar with iPython. They can be executed from the command line (e.g. $ python question1.py). 

###question1.py
This script will simply create and show the required plot.

###question2.py
This script will create a file 'json_dump.txt' and write the required JSON string to the file. A copy of the output is also included for reference: 'json_dump_SAVED.txt'
